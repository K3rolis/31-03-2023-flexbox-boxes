                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every
                penny’s worth.

                experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
                VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
                step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
                curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
